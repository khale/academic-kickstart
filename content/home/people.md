As we see hardware scale up--both in terms of the number of interconnected machines and in terms of the number of computing elements on a single chip--We believe it is time to reconsider some of the design decisions that have sustained the popularity of the Linux/x86 software stack for general-purpose computing. Particularly, how should we organize/structure systems software stacks for future massive-scale machines?"
