As computational infrastructure extends to the edge, it will increasingly offer
the same fine-grained resource provisioning mechanisms used in large-scale
cloud datacenters, and advances in low-latency, wireless networking technology
will allow service providers to blur the distinction between local and remote
resources for commodity computing. From the users' perspectives, their devices
will no longer have fixed computational power, but rather will appear to have
flexible computational capabilities that vary subject to the shared,
disaggregated edge resources available in their physical proximity. System
software will transparently leverage these ephemeral resources to provide
a better end-user experience. We are working on key systems challenges that will enable
such tightly-coupled, disaggregated, and ephemeral infrastructure provisioning.
