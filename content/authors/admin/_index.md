I am an assistant professor in the Department of Computer Science at Illinois
Tech. My research lies at the intersection of operating systems,
high-performance computing, and computer architecture. More specifically, I am
interested in bridging software/hardware layers for enabling both
functionality and performance, as well as questioning assumptions made by the
software stacks we use today. Some projects I've worked on include the [Nautilus
Aerokernel](http://nautilus.halek.co), the Philix Xeon Phi OS toolkit, hypervisor-based code injection,
VMM-guarded, privileged kernel modules, virtualized hardware transactional
memory, and the ConCORD distributed memory tracking system. Find out more in
the [research](#research) section. 

**I am actively looking for new PhD students! Students interested in working with me
should see [this page]({{< ref "/recruiting" >}})**.

If you're an undergrad considering research or going to grad school, you should take
a look at [this page]({{< ref "/ugrad-research" >}}).
